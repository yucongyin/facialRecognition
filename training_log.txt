We are expecting model 2, which has low loss and high score

model5:
max epoch: 1000
init learning rate = 0.1
sample size = 0.3
hidden layer(200,200,200)
tolerance = 0
training time: 66

result: 
entire picture is detected as face

model6:
max epoch: 1000
init learning rate = 0.1
sample size = 0.3
hidden layer(2000)
tolerance = 0
training time: 585 
final interation: 90
loss:0.02219130
score:0.977
result: 7 are detected, no accuracy

model7:
max epoch: 1000
init learning rate = 0.1
sample size = 0.3
hidden layer(50)
tolerance = 0
training time: 9 
final interation: 44
loss:0.03466183
score:0.967
result: 21 are detected, 10 are accurate

so far the best model, let's change into a smaller learning rate to add accuracy

model8:
max epoch: 1000
init learning rate = 0.05
sample size = 0.3
hidden layer(50)
tolerance = 0
training time: 7 
final interation: 37
loss:0.03544650
score:0.992
result: 9 are detected, 4 are accurate

change the size of the test picture to make each face size fit more to the sample size
